estimating dispersions
fitting model and testing
-- note: fitType='parametric', but the dispersion trend was not well captured by the
   function: y = a/x + b, and a local regression fit was automatically substituted.
   specify fitType='local' or 'mean' to avoid this message next time.

Warning messages:
1: In DESeqDataSet(se, design = design, ignoreRank) :
  some variables in design formula are characters, converting to factors
2: ggrepel: 6 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider increasing max.overlaps
